# Enhanced Object Detection based on YOLOv9 for Marine Life

**Presented at CICN 2024 Conference on 23rd December**

---

## Overview

This project presents an enhanced object detection system for marine life, utilizing the YOLOv9 model to identify and classify marine species from underwater images and videos. The goal is to improve the accuracy and speed of marine life detection, which has significant applications in marine conservation, research, and monitoring ecosystems.

This repository includes the model, dataset, and code used to achieve enhanced performance for detecting marine life in real-time conditions.

## Installation Instructions

Since this project is designed to run on **Google Colab**, there is no need for complex local installations. You can simply open the `.ipynb` file in Colab and run it.

### Steps:

1. **Open the Colab notebook**:
   - Download the `.ipynb` file and open it in Colab.
   
2. **Run the cells in the notebook**:
   - The notebook is already set up with all dependencies and instructions to run the object detection pipeline. You just need to execute the cells sequentially.

3. **Ensure GPU is enabled in Colab** (optional for faster execution):
   - Go to **Runtime** > **Change runtime type** > **GPU**.
   
4. **Download the pretrained YOLOv9 model** and any necessary datasets within the Colab notebook (links will be provided in the description).

## Dataset Details

The dataset used for training the YOLOv9 model consists of labeled underwater images and videos containing various marine species. The dataset is essential for training the model to accurately detect and classify marine life.

- **Dataset Source**: [Roboflow](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/aquarium)
- **Number of Images**: [e.g., 5,000+ images]
- **Number of Classes**: [e.g., 10 species, including fish, coral, etc.]
- **Image Dimensions**: [e.g., 416x416]
- **Annotations Format**: [e.g., YOLO format, Pascal VOC, etc.]

Please refer to the Colab notebook for instructions on how to download and use the dataset within the project.
